List of things to be resolved or accomplished:

issues to consider:

- implement Berlekamp-Zassenhaus for modular factorization

- implement IDEALDIV2 with extGB

- implement Musers multivariate factorization, evtl. with sparse Hensel lifting

- implement real roots with other methods, e.g. after Uspensky or Rolle

- implement complex roots with other methods, e.g. after Collins and Krandick

- implement involutive bases computation

- implement signature based GB computation

- make hashCode to reuse computed value --> not immutable

- use further util.concurrent algorithms where possible, e.g. in DHT

- make polynomial chinese remainder generic (?)

- test caching results of gcd computation

- refactor BigDecimal to RingElem and RingFactory, make precision variable

- refactor from BasicLinAlg to GenMatrix and GenVector 

- implement univariate power series composition and power

- add method bitLength() to Element

- make final variables public (?)

- define quotientRemainder in RingElem interface (?)

- remove unnecessary @see since JavaDoc 7 

- make use of gcd in pseudo reduction, needs other coefficient type

- implement matrices to vector

- implement Boolean with RingElem interface (?)

- check solvable polynomials with integral domain coefficients

- refactor method names for groovy operator overloading, make examples for usage

- check usage SDP (Socked Direct Protokol) with Java 7 and InfiniBand

- algebraic number theory

- algebraic topology

- group theory, permutation groups



partially resolved and completed issues:

- provide all Jython examples also for JRuby

- implement multivariate Hensel lifting for multivariate polynomial factorization

- implement 0-dim ideal complex root selection

- refactor package structure to reduce circular dependences

- implement parallel proxys for GB computation

- rework parallel GB algorithms

- implement FGLM GB algorithm

- implement other term orders for multivariate power series

- check the 693 exceptions (including 473 runtime exceptions) that are thrown, 
  reduce number of runtime exceptions

- check for safe publication in constructors, check wrt. the (new) Java memory model

- check and fix Findbugs warnings

- implement squarefree decomposition over fields of characteristic p

- implement absolute polynomial factorization

- implement univaiate and multivariate polynomial factorization

- let arith implementations extend Power as abstract class
  add divide, subtract, abs, remainder to Power, 
  name e.g RingElemAbstract
  clean structure of compareTo, signum and equals
  - is not possible

- define power(n) in RingElem (not done) and implement in edu.jas.structure.Power 
  and classes, done

- add product category to applications
- implement direct products of ring elements

- define FieldElem and Field factory interfaces and use them for GB coefficients

- refactor Hensel lifting to ufd package, not possible because of 
  coefficient replacement trick
  !must be done some how!

- check correct term order in recursive algorithms,
  in GCD ModEval only univariate cases are used, so term order is not a problem

- add assertions to check for number of polynomial variables and term order,
  nvar in GenPolynomial and GenSolvablePolynomial done
